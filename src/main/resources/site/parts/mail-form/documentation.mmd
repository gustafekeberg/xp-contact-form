# Mail form documentation

## Usage

1. First thing to do is to define a unique ID for the form (used to initialize the form and when anchor-linking to the form).
2. Second thing to do is to define your input fields. 
3. Now you can define the responses which will be sent when someone is submitting the form.

## Form configuration

### Markers / Notes / Columns

- Markers
- Notes
- Columns

### Customize messages

Status messages, labels, text on buttons, etc. can be overridden in the app-config.

### Input fields

You will need to define the identifier, what type of input field, and where it should be placed (look at the figure below).

### Responses

It is easy to format response messages. You just fill in your template for the response message in `Response templates`. You can create as many responses as you need. It could for instance be one response message to the one who should receive the message from the contact form, and a copy the the one who sent it.

### Format a response message

Response messages is entered as plain text. Whenever you want to use data from one of the input fields you enter the *value* of the `Field identifier` between two curly braces: `{{value}}`. The curly braces and it's content will then be replaced with the data of the input field with the corresponding name.

Example of a response template for the `Message body`:

```
{{name}} sent a message.
Phone: {{phone}}
E-mail: {{email}}

Copy of message below line:
----------

{{message}}
```

If the fields is filled in like this:

```
name    = This Person
phone   = 123 456 789
email   = my@email.com
message = This is my message to you. Can you send me a reply?
```

Then the generated message will look like this:

```
This Person sent a message.
Phone: 123 456 789
E-mail: my@email.com

Copy of message below line:
----------

This is my message to you. Can you send me a reply?
```

The `field identifiers` is used in the other fields too.

- To format the `Subject` it's possible to enter: `Message from contact form - sender: {{name}}`. This will generate this subject to the message: `Message from contact form - sender: This Person`
- `Reply to` can be formatted with a plain e-mail-address: `no-reply@domain`, or with a `field identifier`: `{{email}}`

## Customization

### CSS

It's possible to add custom CSS. Use css-class `easy-contact-form` to style the form.

The textarea have a special class that set it's height to the height of a input field multiplied by the number of fields: `textarea-height-1`, `textarea-height-2`, `textarea-height-3`, `textarea-height-...` (this is useful if you want to match the height of the textarea to the height of the input fields when using multiple columns). If you select the default height the class will be set to `.textarea-height-0` which has the css-rule `height: auto`.

To customize the height of the textarea you can enter something like this in the field for custom CSS:

```
.easy-contact-form .textarea-height-0 { height: 300px; }
```
