# Mail form documentation

## Usage

1. First thing to do is to define a unique ID for the form (used to initialize the form and when anchor-linking to the form).
2. Second thing to do is to define your input fields. 
3. Now you can define the responses which will be sent when someone is submitting the form.

### Form config

### Input fields

You will need to define the identifier, what type of input field, and where it should be placed (look at figure below).

### Responses

It is easy to format response messages. You just fill in your template for the response message in `Response templates`. You need to create one for the receiver of the form, and one for the sender of the form. The second template is only used if you've checked the option `Send a note to the sender`.

#### Format a response message

Response messages is entered as plain text. Whenever you want to use data from one of the input fields you enter the *value* of the `Field identifier` between two curly braces: `{{value}}`. The curly braces and it's content will then be replaced with the data of the input field with the corresponding name.
